## Binary Search Trees

A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree where each node contains a key and optional associated value. It allows particularly fast lookup, addition, and removal of items.

The nodes in a binary search tree must be have some properties:

* The left subtree of a particular node will always contain nodes with keys less than that node's key.
* The right subtree of a particular node will always contain nodes with keys greater than that node's key. 
* The keys in binary search tree must be unique.
